# Doctor's Garden

A Single-page MERN Stack hospital web-app. It has two dashboards. One is for the patient, where people can get an appointment and after the appointed patient can see their prescription where the doctor will give the list of medicines. Another dashboard is for doctors, where doctors can see the list of all the appointed patients. Here the doctors will give the necessary medicine to the patient and if the doctor wants, then he can cancel the patient's appointment.
